# Industria de Videojuegos

## What was used? 
The project was carried out using the Power BI desktop application, one of the top leader in business Intelligence, and published on the web.

### Get Data

_The data used was provided for educational purposes in the Power BI - Data Analysis and Business Intelligence course on the Udemy platform._
[Here is the excel file](https://github.com/dhugueth/Industria-de-Videojuegos/files/7528813/Ventas%2BVideojuegos.xlsx)

### Data Preparation

Modifications were made to the data obtained from the Excel file to be able to use them appropriately using the Power Query editor. 

The modifications were: 

- The column "Ventas global" was eliminated because it generates a duplication in the values.
- 4 columns were unified to two columns, with the option "Unpivot columns", in order to have all the sales values in one column and the regions in another column.
- Region names have been replaced for clarity. 
- The type of field assigned by Power BI to the column "a√±o" was replaced to text to be consistent with the desired purposes.
